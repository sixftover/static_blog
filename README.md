### Requitements

###### Install all packages
Open ./development/dev/ in the terminal and install all modules.
```
npm install
```

Please DO NOT touch the following files:
- /development/dev/package.json
- /development/dev/gulpfile.js
- /development/dev/node_modules/

## Gulp Commands

###### Clean
This command removes all files generated by Gulp. It shouldn't be needed, but is here for bug fixing.
```javascript
gulp clean

1. Deletes HTML, CSS & JS Files in [./dev]
2. Deletes everything in [./public]
```

###### Development Mode
Run this command before editing any files. Gulp will process files upon save and update a local host server. Refer to your terminal for the URL.
```javascript
gulp serve

1. Deletes HTML, CSS & JS Files in [./dev]
2. Compiles SASS
3. Adds vendor prefixes
4. Tidies up HTML
3. Connects to localhost (URL in console)
4. Watches HTML & CSS for updates (reloads on save)
```

###### Build
Gulp processes all files but does not start the local server.
```javascript
gulp build

1. Deletes HTML, CSS & JS Files in [./dev]
2. Compiles SASS
3. Adds vendor prefixes
4. Tidies up HTML
```

###### Publish
Gulp processes all files, minifies, and then packages it in to the /public folder.
```javascript
gulp publish

1. Deletes all files in [./public]
2. Deletes HTML, CSS & JS Files in [./dev]
3. Compiles SASS
4. Adds vendor prefixes
5. Tidies up HTML
6. minifies CSS
7. Copies [/dev] to [/public]
8. Copies [/public_setup] to [/public]
```
