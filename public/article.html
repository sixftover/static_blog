				<p>Fuck. Learn from fucking criticism. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. Form follows fucking function. Remember it’s called the creative process, it’s not the creative fucking moment. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother?</p>
				<p>Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. Use your fucking hands. Respect your fucking craft. Respect your fucking craft.</p>
				<p>Think about all the fucking possibilities. Never let your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. Must-do is a good fucking master. This design is fucking brilliant. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the fucking possibility of failure.</p> <span class="img"><img src="img/stock/stock-city2.jpg" width="1280" height="720" alt="Featured Image" /></span> <span class="img"><img src="img/stock/stock-city3.jpg" width="1280" height="720" alt="Featured Image" /></span>
				<p>Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. Design is all about fucking relationships—the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship of designer and user. Don’t worry about what other people fucking think. Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable.</p>
				<p>Don’t fucking lie to yourself. The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations. You are not your fucking work. Must-do is a good fucking master.</p>
				<p>If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old. This design is fucking brilliant. Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning.</p>

				<p>Don’t worry about what other people fucking think. Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop clicking your mouse, get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original. The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display.

Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal.

The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere.

				<p>Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.” Design is all about fucking relationships—the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship of designer and user. Form follows fucking function.</p>

Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.”</p>
